# Contributing to @konitif/core

Consumer documentation belongs in `README.md`. Machine-readable package
documentation belongs in `reference/`; release policy and provenance remain in
their dedicated repository files.

Use the committed lockfile and disable lifecycle scripts during installation:

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund
npm run build
npm test
npm run verify:package
```

Do not publish from a working tree. Follow `RELEASE.md` and qualify the exact
archive through the repository workflow.
